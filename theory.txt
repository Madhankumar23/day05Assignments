Question:-
Read about the difference between window , screen and document in javascript

Answer:-
    In JavaScript "window", "screen", and "document" are objects that represent different aspects of the browser environment. Let's explore the differences between them:

Window:
    The "Window" object is the global object in a browser environment. It represents the browser window or tab.

    It is the top-level object, and properties and methods attached to it are global and can be accessed from any part of the script.

    For example, "window.innerWidth" represents the inner width of the browser window.


Screen:
    The "Screen" object represents the physical screen or monitor where the browser is being displayed.

    It provides information about the user's screen, such as width, height, color depth, etc.

    Example properties include "screen.width" and "screen.height", representing the resolution of the screen.


Document:
    The "Document" object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.

    It provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document, such as accessing elements, modifying the DOM, and handling events.

    For example, "document.getElementById('elementId')" is used to retrieve an HTML element by its ID.


Example Code:-
window example
console.log(window.innerWidth); Get the inner width of the browser window

screen example
console.log(screen.width); Get the screen width in pixels

document example
const element = document.getElementById('myElement'); Get an element by its ID
element.textContent = 'Hello, World!'; Change the text content of the element


Differences:
     "Window" represents the entire browser window,
     "Screen" provides information about the user's physical screen and
     "Document" represents the loaded HTML document with methods for manipulation and interaction.
